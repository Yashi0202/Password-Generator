# üîê Password Generator & Viewer

**Password Generator & Viewer** is a secure and user-friendly Python application designed to help users generate strong passwords, encrypt them for safe storage, and later decrypt and view them when needed. 

Built with `tkinter` and styled using `ttkbootstrap`, the app provides a modern GUI experience and uses `cryptography.Fernet` for robust encryption. This tool is ideal for developers, power users, or anyone who needs a local password management utility without relying on cloud storage or online password managers.
